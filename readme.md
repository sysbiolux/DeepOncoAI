The goal of this project is to build the best predictive model of the sensitivity or resistance of cancer cell lines to multiple drugs.
The model is built upon the CCLE database. Primary data is the RPPA dataset and the pharmacological profiles.
Part 1: using only the proteomics data, design the best features to enhance the predictivity with FALCON, graph embeddings, and data augmentation.
Part 2: assess the use of RNAseq, microarray, CNV, genotype, and methylation data to increase the predictivity.
