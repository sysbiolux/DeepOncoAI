abstract = {Background: Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Through a predictive model, important cancer marker genes can be inferred. Several studies have attempted to build machine learning models for this task however none has taken into consideration the effects of tissue of origin that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers. Results: In this paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and tested on gene expression profiles from combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 713 matched normal tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent prediction accuracies (93.9-95.0%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal). Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, 1D-CNN model, with a guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2090 cancer markers (108 per class on average). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1. Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for the prediction of breast cancer subtypes and achieved an average accuracy of 88.42% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be found at https://github.com/chenlabgccri/CancerTypePrediction. Conclusions: Here we present novel CNN designs for accurate and simultaneous cancer/normal and cancer types prediction based on gene expression profiles, and unique model interpretation scheme to elucidate biologically relevance of cancer marker genes after eliminating the effects of tissue-of-origin. The proposed model has light hyperparameters to be trained and thus can be easily adapted to facilitate cancer diagnosis in the future.},

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate prediction of cancer drug response (CDR) is challenging due to the uncertainty of drug efficacy and heterogeneity of cancer patients. Strong evidences have implicated the high dependence of CDR on tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles of individual patients. Precise identification of CDR is crucial in both guiding anti-cancer drug design and understanding cancer biology. Results: In this study, we present DeepCDR which integrates multi-omics profiles of cancer cells and explores intrinsic chemical structures of drugs for predicting cancer drug response. Specifically, DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network (UGCN) and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs. Extensive experiments showed that DeepCDR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression settings under various data settings. We also evaluated the contribution of different types of omics profiles for assessing drug response. Furthermore, we provided an exploratory strategy for identifying potential cancer-associated genes concerning specific cancer types. Our results highlighted the predictive power of DeepCDR and its potential translational value in guiding disease-specific drug design.

Generally, genomic features are regarded as the state-of-the-art method for stratifying patients for targeted therapies. In this work, we conduct the first rigorous comparison of DNA- and expression-based predictive models for viability across five datasets encompassing chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that expression consistently outperforms DNA for predicting vulnerabilities, including many currently stratified by canonical DNA markers. Contrary to their perception in the literature, the most accurate expression-based models depend on few features and are amenable to biological interpretation.

abstract = {Background: Drug response prediction is an important problem in computational personalized medicine. Many machine learning-, especially deep learning-, based methods have been proposed for this task. However, these methods often represented the drugs as strings, which are not a natural way to depict molecules. Also, interpretation has not been considered thoroughly in these methods. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel method, GraphDRP, based on graph convolutional network for the problem. In GraphDRP, drugs are represented in molecular graphs directly capturing the bonds among atoms, meanwhile cell lines are depicted as binary vectors of genomic aberrations. Representative features of drugs and cell lines are learned by convolution layers, then combined to represent for each drug-cell line pair. Finally, the response value of each drug-cell line pair is predicted by a fully-connected neural network. Four variants of graph convolutional networks are used for learning the features of drugs. Results: We find that GraphDRP outperforms tCNN in all performance measures for all experiments. Also, through saliency maps of the resulting GraphDRP models, we discover the contribution of the genomic aberrations to the responses. Conclusion: Representing drugs as graphs are able to improve the performance of drug response prediction. Data and source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/hauldhut/GraphDRP.},

Although current models for drug response prediction are becoming more accurate, they are also 'black boxes' and cannot explain their predictions, which is of particular importance in cancer treatment. Many models also do not leverage prior biological knowledge, such as the hierarchical information on how proteins form complexes and act together in pathways. Results: In this work, we use this prior biological knowledge to form the architecture of a deep neural network to predict cancer drug response from cell line gene expression data. We find that our approach not only has a low prediction error compared to baseline models but also allows meaningful interpretation of the network. These interpretations can both explain predictions made and discover novel connections in the biological knowledge that may lead to new hypotheses about mechanisms of drug action. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical in-vitro cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients. We designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples' tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide better prediction performance. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs' mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival.},

Recent large-scale cancer pharmacogenomic studies have boosted the research for finding predictive biomarkers by profiling thousands of human cancer cell lines at the molecular level and screening them with hundreds of approved drugs and experimental chemical compounds. Many studies have leveraged these data to build predictive models of response using various statistical and machine learning methods. However, a common challenge in these methods is the lack of interpretability as to how they make the predictions and which features were the most associated with response, hindering the clinical translation of these models. To alleviate this issue, we develop a new machine learning pipeline based on the recent LOBICO approach that explores the space of bimodally expressed genes in multiple large in vitro pharmacogenomic studies and builds multivariate, nonlinear, yet interpretable logic-based models predictive of drug response. Using our method, we used a compendium of three of the largest pharmacogenomic data sets to build robust and interpretable models for 101 drugs that span 17 drug classes with high validation rate in independent datasets.},

We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to $\sim$17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data (https://edelgene.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug. We further demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes.

Critically, the sensitivity of cancer cells to treatment depends on an unknown subset of a large number of biological features. Here, we compare standard, data-driven feature selection approaches to feature selection driven by prior knowledge of drug targets, target pathways, and gene expression signatures. We asses these methodologies on Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset, evaluating 2484 unique models. For 23 drugs, better predictive performance is achieved when the features are selected according to prior knowledge of drug targets and pathways. The best correlation of observed and predicted response using the test set is achieved for Linifanib (r = 0.75). Extending the drug-dependent features with gene expression signatures yields the most predictive models for 60 drugs, with the best performing example of Dabrafenib. For many compounds, even a very small subset of drug-related features is highly predictive of drug sensitivity. Small feature sets selected using prior knowledge are more predictive for drugs targeting specific genes and pathways, while models with wider feature sets perform better for drugs affecting general cellular mechanisms. Appropriate feature selection strategies facilitate the development of interpretable models that are indicative for therapy design.},

In order to counteract this effect that tends to lead to just one data type dominating supposedly multi-omics models, we developed a novel tool that enables users to train single-omics models separately in a first step and to integrate them into a multi-omics model in a second step. Extensive ablation studies are performed in order to facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the respective contributions of singular data types and of combinations thereof, effectively identifying redundancies and interdependencies between them. Moreover, the integration of the single-omics models is realized by a range of distinct classification algorithms, thus allowing for a performance comparison.},

abstract = {The identification of new targeted and personalized therapies for cancer requires the fast and accurate assessment of the drug efficacy of potential compounds against a particular biomolecular sample. It has been suggested that the integration of complementary sources of information might strengthen the accuracy of a drug efficacy prediction model. Here, we present a web-based platform for the Prediction of AntiCancer Compound sensitivity with Multimodal Attention-based Neural Networks (PaccMann). PaccMann is trained on public transcriptomic cell line profiles, compound structure information and drug sensitivity screenings, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on anticancer drug sensitivity prediction. On the open-access web service (https://ibm.biz/paccmann-aas), users can select a known drug compound or design their own compound structure in an interactive editor, perform in-silico drug testing and investigate compound efficacy on publicly available or user-provided transcriptomic profiles. PaccMann leverages methods for model interpretability and outputs confidence scores as well as attention heatmaps that highlight the genes and chemical sub-structures that were more important to make a prediction, hence facilitating the understanding of the model's decision making and the involved biochemical processes. We hope to serve the community with a toolbox for fast and efficient validation in drug repositioning or lead compound identification regimes.},

Yet, creating such models for patients, in particular for solid malignancies, is challenging. A major hurdle to build these models is the limited material available, that precludes the generation of large-scale perturbation data. Here, we present an approach that couples ex vivo high-throughput screenings of cancer biopsies using microfluidics with logic-based modeling to generate patient-specific dynamic models of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. We used the resulting models to investigate heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer patients, showing dissimilarities especially in the PI3K-Akt pathway. Variation in model parameters reflected well the different tumor stages. Finally, we used our dynamic models to efficaciously predict new personalized combinatorial treatments. Our results suggest our combination of microfluidic experiments and mathematical model can be a novel tool toward cancer precision medicine.},

abstract = {Background: Many functional analysis tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events and low library sizes. It is thus not clear if functional TF and pathway analysis tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way. Results: To address this question, we perform benchmark studies on simulated and real scRNA-seq data. We include the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment, and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compare them against the tools SCENIC/AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study, we simulate single cells from TF/pathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. We complement the simulated data with real scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on simulated and real data reveal comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we show that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell type-specific variability by analyzing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq protocols. We also provide the benchmark data for further use by the community. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that bulk-based functional analysis tools that use manually curated footprint gene sets can be applied to scRNA-seq data, partially outperforming dedicated single-cell tools. Furthermore, we find that the performance of functional analysis tools is more sensitive to the gene sets than to the statistic used.},

Machine learning(ML) algorithms can be trained on high-throughput screening data to develop models that are able to predict the response of cancer cell lines and patients to novel drugs or drug combinations.

These types of models have unique characteristics that may make them more suitable for the complex task of modeling drug response based on both biological and chemical data, but the application of DL to drug response prediction has been unexplored until very recently. The few studies that have been published have shown promising results, and the use of DL for drug response prediction is beginning to attract greater interest from researchers in the field. In this article, we critically review recently published studies that have employed DL methods to predict drug response in cancer cell lines. We also provide a brief description of DL and the main types of architectures that have been used in these studies.

By predicting accurate anticancer responses, oncologists achieve a complete understanding of the effective treatment for each patient. In this paper, we present DSPLMF (Drug Sensitivity Prediction using Logistic Matrix Factorization) approach based on Recommender Systems. DSPLMF focuses on discovering effective features of cell lines and drugs for computing the probability of the cell lines are sensitive to drugs by logistic matrix factorization approach. Since similar cell lines and similar drugs may have similar drug responses and incorporating similarities between cell lines and drugs can potentially improve the drug response prediction, gene expression profile, copy number alteration, and single-nucleotide mutation information are used for cell line similarity and chemical structures of drugs are used for drug similarity. Evaluation of the proposed method on CCLE and GDSC datasets and comparison with some of the state-of-the-art methods indicates that the result of DSPLMF is significantly more accurate and more efficient than these methods. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed method, the obtained latent vectors are used to identify subtypes of cancer of the cell line and the predicted IC50 values are used to depict drug-pathway associations.

Recently several online databases and consortiums have contributed to providing open access to pharmacogenomic data. These databases have helped in developing computational approaches for drug sensitivity prediction. Cancer is a complex disease involving the heterogeneous behaviour of same tumour-type patients towards the same kind of drug therapy. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to predict drug sensitivity. However, these methods are not efficient enough to predict drug sensitivity. The present study has proposed an ensemble learning framework for drug-response prediction using a modified rotation forest. The proposed framework is further compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms and two baseline methods using Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) drug screens. The authors have also predicted missing drug response values in the data set using the proposed approach. The proposed approach outperforms other counterparts even though gene mutation data is not incorporated while designing the approach. An average mean square error of 3.14 and 0.404 is achieved using GDSC and CCLE drug screens, respectively.

In particular, precisely predicting drug response in specific cancer types and patients is still a challenge problem. Here we propose Meta-GDBP, a novel anticancer drug-response model, which involves two levels. At the first level of Meta-GDBP, we build four optimized base models (BMs) using genetic information, chemical properties and biological context with an ensemble optimization strategy, while at the second level, we construct a weighted model to integrate the four BMs. Notably, the weights of the models are learned upstream, thus the parameter cost is significantly reduced compared to previous methods. We evaluate the Meta-GDBP on Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data sets. Benchmarking results demonstrate that compared to other methods, the Meta-GDBP achieves a much higher correlation between the predicted and the observed responses for almost all the drugs. Moreover, we apply the Meta-GDBP to predict the GDSC-missing drug response and use the CCLE-known data to validate the performance. The results show quite a similar tendency between these two response sets. Particularly, we here for the first time introduce a biological context-based frequency matrix (BCFM) to associate the biological context with the drug response. It is encouraging that the proposed BCFM is biologically meaningful and consistent with the reported biological mechanism, further demonstrating its efficacy for predicting drug response.

abstract = {In line with recent advances in neural drug design and sensitivity prediction, we propose a novel architecture for interpretable prediction of anticancer compound sensitivity using a multimodal attention-based convolutional encoder. Our model is based on the three key pillars of drug sensitivity: Compounds' structure in the form of a SMILES sequence, gene expression profiles of tumors, and prior knowledge on intracellular interactions from protein-protein interaction networks. We demonstrate that our multiscale convolutional attention-based encoder significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints and a selection of encoders based on SMILES, as well as the previously reported state-of-the-art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.89). Moreover, the explainability of our approach is demonstrated by a thorough analysis of the attention weights. We show that the attended genes significantly enrich apoptotic processes and that the drug attention is strongly correlated with a standard chemical structure similarity index. Finally, we report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on a leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative genes and submolecular regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated generalizability and the interpretability of our model testify to its potential for in silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen cancer cells, positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {The biological processes involved in a drug's mechanisms of action are oftentimes dynamic, complex and difficult to discern. Time-course gene expression data is a rich source of information that can be used to unravel these complex processes, identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and predict the response to a drug. However, the majority of previous work has not fully utilized this temporal dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is either considered at one time-point (before the administration of the drug) or two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug). This is clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for applications such as long-term drug therapy. In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for drug response prediction by taking advantage of time-course gene expression data. Our goal is to predict drug response values at every stage of a long-term treatment, given the expression levels of genes collected in the previous time-points. To this end, REP employs a built-in recursive structure that exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past values of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing data, but also predict unseen gene expression levels (GELs). These advantages enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment from some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment. Extensive experiments on a dataset corresponding to 53 multiple sclerosis patients treated with interferon are included to showcase the effectiveness of REP.},

abstract = {Motivation: Human genomic datasets often contain sensitive information that limits use and sharing of the data. In particular, simple anonymization strategies fail to provide sufficient level of protection for genomic data, because the data are inherently identifiable. Differentially private machine learning can help by guaranteeing that the published results do not leak too much information about any individual data point. Recent research has reached promising results on differentially private drug sensitivity prediction using gene expression data. Differentially private learning with genomic data is challenging because it is more difficult to guarantee privacy in high dimensions. Dimensionality reduction can help, but if the dimension reduction mapping is learned from the data, then it needs to be differentially private too, which can carry a significant privacy cost. Furthermore, the selection of any hyperparameters (such as the target dimensionality) needs to also avoid leaking private information. Results: We study an approach that uses a large public dataset of similar type to learn a compact representation for differentially private learning. We compare three representation learning methods: variational autoencoders, principal component analysis and random projection. We solve two machine learning tasks on gene expression of cancer cell lines: cancer type classification, and drug sensitivity prediction. The experiments demonstrate significant benefit from all representation learning methods with variational autoencoders providing the most accurate predictions most often. Our results significantly improve over previous state-of-the-art in accuracy of differentially private drug sensitivity prediction.},

abstract = {High-throughput drug screening has facilitated the discovery of drug combinations in cancer. Many existing studies adopted a full matrix design, aiming for the characterization of drug pair effects for cancer cells. However, the full matrix design may be suboptimal as it requires a drug pair to be combined at multiple concentrations in a full factorial manner. Furthermore, many of the computational tools assess only the synergy but not the sensitivity of drug combinations, which might lead to false positive discoveries. We proposed a novel cross design to enable a more cost-effective and simultaneous testing of drug combination sensitivity and synergy. We developed a drug combination sensitivity score (CSS) to determine the sensitivity of a drug pair, and showed that the CSS is highly reproducible between the replicates and thus supported its usage as a robust metric. We further showed that CSS can be predicted using machine learning approaches which determined the top pharmaco-features to cluster cancer cell lines based on their drug combination sensitivity profiles. To assess the degree of drug interactions using the cross design, we developed an S synergy score based on the difference between the drug combination and the single drug dose-response curves. We showed that the S score is able to detect true synergistic and antagonistic drug combinations at an accuracy level comparable to that using the full matrix design. Taken together, we showed that the cross design coupled with the CSS sensitivity and S synergy scoring methods may provide a robust and accurate characterization of both drug combination sensitivity and synergy levels, with minimal experimental materials required.

Researchers have developed a variety of computational methods to discover associations between drugs and cell lines, and improved drug sensitivity analyses by integrating heterogeneous biological data. However, choosing informative data sources and methods that can incorporate multiple sources efficiently is the challenging part of successful analysis in personalized medicine. The reason is that finding decisive factors of cancer and developing methods that can overcome the problems of integrating data, such as differences in data structures and data complexities, are difficult. In this review, we summarize recent advances in data integration-based machine learning for drug response prediction, by categorizing methods as matrix factorization-based, kernel-based and network-based methods. We also present a short description of relevant databases used as a benchmark in drug response prediction analyses, followed by providing a brief discussion of challenges faced in integrating and interpreting data from multiple sources. Finally, we address the advantages of combining multiple heterogeneous data sources on drug sensitivity analysis by showing an experimental comparison. Contact:betul.guvenc@aalto.fi},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the phenotypic drug response on cancer cell lines plays a vital role in anti-cancer drug discovery and re-purposing. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database provides open data for researchers in phenotypic screening to build and test their models. Previously, most research in these areas starts from the molecular fingerprints or physiochemical features of drugs, instead of their structures. Results: In this paper, a model called twin Convolutional Neural Network for drugs in SMILES format (tCNNS) is introduced for phenotypic screening. tCNNS uses a convolutional network to extract features for drugs from their simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) format and uses another convolutional network to extract features for cancer cell lines from the genetic feature vectors respectively. After that, a fully connected network is used to predict the interaction between the drugs and the cancer cell lines. When the training set and the testing set are divided based on the interaction pairs between drugs and cell lines, tCNNS achieves 0.826, 0.831 for the mean and top quartile of the coefficient of determinant (R 2) respectively and 0.909, 0.912 for the mean and top quartile of the Pearson correlation (R p ) respectively, which are significantly better than those of the previous works (Ammad-Ud-Din et al., J Chem Inf Model 54:2347-9, 2014), (Haider et al., PLoS ONE 10:0144490, 2015), (Menden et al., PLoS ONE 8:61318, 2013). However, when the training set and the testing set are divided exclusively based on drugs or cell lines, the performance of tCNNS decreases significantly and R p and R 2 drop to barely above 0. Conclusions: Our approach is able to predict the drug effects on cancer cell lines with high accuracy, and its performance remains stable with less but high-quality data, and with fewer features for the cancer cell lines. tCNNS can also solve the problem of outliers in other feature space. Besides achieving high scores in these statistical metrics, tCNNS also provides some insights into the phenotypic screening. However, the performance of tCNNS drops in the blind test.},

abstract = {Background: The availability and generation of large amounts of genomic data has led to the development of a new paradigm in cancer treatment emphasizing a precision approach at the molecular and genomic level. Statistical modeling techniques aimed at leveraging broad scale in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data for precision drug treatment has become an active area of research. As a rapidly developing discipline at the crossroads of medicine, computer science, and mathematics, techniques ranging from accepted to those on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence have been utilized. Given the diversity and complexity of these techniques a systematic understanding of fundamental modeling principles is essential to contextualize influential factors to better understand results and develop new approaches. Methods: Using data available from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the NCI60 we explore principle components regression, linear and non-linear support vector regression, and artificial neural networks in combination with different implementations of correlation based feature selection (CBF) on the prediction of drug response for several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Results: Our results indicate that the regression method and features used have marginal effects on Spearman correlation between the predicted and measured values as well as prediction error. Detailed analysis of these results reveal that the bulk relationship between tissue of origin and drug response is a major driving factor in model performance. Conclusion: These results display one of the challenges in building predictive models for drug response in pan-cancer models. Mainly, that bulk genotypic traits where the signal to noise ratio is high is the dominant behavior captured in these models. This suggests that improved techniques of feature selection that can discriminate individual cell response from histotype response will yield more successful pan-cancer models.},

abstract = {The selection of effective genes that accurately predict chemotherapy responses might improve cancer outcomes. We compare optimized gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin responses in the same cell lines and validate each signature using data from patients with cancer. Supervised support vector machine learning is used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values by backwards feature selection with cross-validation. Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer were used to test the cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin signatures, resulting in 71.0%, 60.2%, and 54.5% accuracies in predicting disease recurrence and 59%, 61%, and 72% accuracies in predicting remission, respectively. One cisplatin signature predicted 100% of recurrence in non-smoking patients with bladder cancer (57% disease-free; N = 19), and 79% recurrence in smokers (62% disease-free; N = 35). This approach should be adaptable to other studies of chemotherapy responses, regardless of the drug or cancer types.},

abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer is often caused by different patterns of genetic alterations. Understanding such phenotype-genotype relationships is fundamental for the advance of personalized medicine. One of the important challenges in the area is to predict drug response on a personalized level. The pathway-centric view of cancer significantly advanced the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. However, most of network identification methods in cancer focus on identifying subnetworks that include general cancer drivers or are associated with discrete features such as cancer subtypes, hence cannot be applied directly for the analysis of continuous features like drug response. On the other hand, existing genome wide association approaches do not fully utilize the complex proprieties of cancer mutational landscape. To address these challenges, we propose a computational method, named NETPHIX (NETwork-to-PHenotpe assocIation with eXlusivity), which aims to identify mutated subnetworks that are associated with drug response (or any continuous cancer phenotype). Utilizing properties such as mutual exclusivity and interactions among genes, we formulate the problem as an integer linear program and solve it optimally to obtain a set of genes satisfying the constraints. NETPHIX identified gene modules significantly associated with many drugs, including interesting response modules to MEK1/2 inhibitors in both directions (increased and decreased sensitivity to the drug) that the previous method, which does not utilize network information, failed to identify. The genes in the modules belong to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is the targeted pathway of the drug.},

Materials and Methods Penalized regression, combined with an individualized pathway score algorithm, was applied to construct a predictive model using publically available genomic cohorts of ATR and intrinsic taxane resistance (ITR). To develop a model with enhanced generalizability, we merged multiple ATR studies then updated the learning parameter via robust cross-study validation. Results For internal cross-study validation, the ATR model produced a perfect performance with an overall area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 1.000 with an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 1.000, a Brier score of 0.007, a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. The model showed an excellent performance on two independent blind ATR cohorts (overall AUROC of 0.940, AUPRC of 0.940, a Brier score of 0.127). When we applied our algorithm to two large-scale pharmacogenomic resources for ITR, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), an overall ITR cross-study AUROC was 0.70, which is a far better accuracy than an almost random level reported by previous studies. Furthermore, this model had a high transferability on blind ATR cohorts with an AUROC of 0.69, suggesting that general predictive features may be at work across both ITR and ATR. Conclusion We successfully constructed a multi-study–derived personalized prediction model for ATR with excellent accuracy, generalizability, and transferability.},

abstract = {Precision medicine has become a novel and rising concept, which depends much on the identification of individual genomic signatures for different patients. The cancer cell lines could reflect the “omic” diversity of primary tumors, based on which many works have been carried out to study the cancer biology and drug discovery both in experimental and computational aspects. In this work, we presented a novel method to utilize weighted graph regularized matrix factorization (WGRMF) for inferring anticancer drug response in cell lines. We constructed a p-nearest neighbor graph to sparsify drug similarity matrix and cell line similarity matrix, respectively. Using the sparsified matrices in the graph regularization terms, we performed matrix factorization to generate the latent matrices for drug and cell line. The graph regularization terms including neighbor information could help to exclude the noisy ingredient and improve the prediction accuracy. The 10-fold cross-validation was implemented, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), PCCsr, and RMSEsr averaged over all drugs were calculated to evaluate the performance of WGRMF. The results on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset are 0.64 ± 0.16, 1.37 ± 0.35, 0.73 ± 0.14, and 1.71 ± 0.44 for PCC, RMSE, PCCsr, and RMSEsr in turn. And for the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset, WGRMF got results of 0.72 ± 0.09, 0.56 ± 0.19, 0.79 ± 0.07, and 0.69 ± 0.19, respectively. The results showed the superiority of WGRMF compared with previous methods. Besides, based on the prediction results using the GDSC dataset, three types of case studies were carried out. The results from both cross-validation and case studies have shown the effectiveness of WGRMF on the prediction of drug response in cell lines.},

We integrated both genomic features of cell lines and chemical information of compounds to predict the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets using a deep neural network, which we called DeepDSC. Specifically, we first applied a stacked deep autoencoder to extract genomic features of cell lines from gene expression data, and then combined the compounds' chemical features to these genomic features to produce final response data. We conducted 10-fold cross-validation to demonstrate the performance of our deep model in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination R2 . We show that our model outperforms the previous approaches with RMSE of 0.23 and R2 of 0.78 on CCLE dataset, and RMSE of 0.52 and R2 of 0.78 on GDSC dataset, respectively. Moreover, to demonstrate the prediction ability of our models on novel cell lines or novel compounds, we left cell lines originating from the same tissue and each compound out as the test sets, respectively, and the rest as training sets. The performance was comparable to other methods.},

The proposed method explicitly addresses two fundamental issues in drug sensitivity prediction, namely, population heterogeneity and feature selection pertaining to each of the subpopulations. The mixture regression model is estimated using the imputation-conditional consistency algorithm, and the resulting estimator is consistent. This paper also proposes an average-BIC criterion for determining the number of components for the mixture regression model. The proposed method is applied to the CCLE dataset, and the numerical results indicate that the proposed method can make a drastic improvement over the existing ones, such as random forest, support vector regression, and regularized linear regression, in both drug sensitivity prediction and feature selection. The p-values for the comparisons in drug sensitivity prediction can reach the order O(10 −8 ) or lower for the drugs with heterogeneous populations.},

abstract = {Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype-phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a large-scale pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines a molecular network that encodes known gene-gene as well as gene-pathway relationships, and determines a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes whose basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines are correlated with cytotoxic response to a com- pound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from data-bases of compound target genes and large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses on chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanisms of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate prediction of anticancer drug responses in cell lines is a crucial step to accomplish the precision medicine in oncology. Although many popular computational models have been proposed towards this non-trivial issue, there is still room for improving the prediction performance by combining multiple types of genome-wide molecular data. Results: We first demonstrated an observation on the CCLE and GDSC datasets, i.e., genetically similar cell lines always exhibit higher response correlations to structurally related drugs. Based on this observation we built a cell line-drug complex network model, named CDCN model. It captures different contributions of all available cell line-drug responses through cell line similarities and drug similarities. We executed anticancer drug response prediction on CCLE and GDSC independently. The result is significantly superior to that of some existing studies. More importantly, our model could predict the response of new drug to new cell line with considerable performance. We also divided all possible cell lines into "sensitive" and "resistant" groups by their response values to a given drug, the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and goodness of fit are also very promising. Conclusion: CDCN model is a comprehensive tool to predict anticancer drug responses. Compared with existing methods, it is able to provide more satisfactory prediction results with less computational consumption.},

abstract = {Background: Predicting cellular responses to drugs has been a major challenge for personalized drug therapy regimen. Recent pharmacogenomic studies measured the sensitivities of heterogeneous cell lines to numerous drugs, and provided valuable data resources to develop and validate computational approaches for the prediction of drug responses. Most of current approaches predict drug sensitivity by building prediction models with individual genes, which suffer from low reproducibility due to biologic variability and difficulty to interpret biological relevance of novel gene-drug associations. As an alternative, pathway activity scores derived from gene expression could predict drug response of cancer cells. Method: In this study, pathway-based prediction models were built with four approaches inferring pathway activity in unsupervised manner, including competitive scoring approaches (DiffRank and GSVA) and self-contained scoring approaches (PLAGE and Z-score). These unsupervised pathway activity inference approaches were applied to predict drug responses of cancer cells using data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Results: Our analysis on all the 24 drugs from CCLE demonstrated that pathway-based models achieved better predictions for 14 out of the 24 drugs, while taking fewer features as inputs. Further investigation on indicated that pathway-based models indeed captured pathways involving drug-related genes (targets, transporters and metabolic enzymes) for majority of drugs, whereas gene-models failed to identify these drug-related genes, in most cases. Among the four approaches, competitive scoring (DiffRank and GSVA) provided more accurate predictions and captured more pathways involving drug-related genes than self-contained scoring (PLAGE and Z-Score). Detailed interpretation of top pathways from the top method (DiffRank) highlights the merit of pathway-based approaches to predict drug response by identifying pathways relevant to drug mechanisms. Conclusion: Taken together, pathway-based modeling with inferred pathway activity is a promising alternative to predict drug response, with the ability to easily interpret results and provide biological insights into the mechanisms of drug actions.},

abstract = {Drug sensitivity prediction for individual tumors is a significant challenge in personalized medicine. Current modeling approaches consider prediction of a single metric of the drug response curve such as AUC or IC 50 . However, the single summary metric of a dose-response curve fails to provide the entire drug sensitivity profile which can be used to design the optimal dose for a patient. In this article, we assess the problem of predicting the complete dose-response curve based on genetic characterizations. We propose an enhancement to the popular ensemble-based Random Forests approach that can directly predict the entire functional profile of a dose-response curve rather than a single summary metric. We design functional regression trees with node costs modified based on dose/response region dependence methodologies and response distribution based approaches. Our results relative to large pharmacological databases such as CCLE and GDSC show a higher accuracy in predicting dose-response curves of the proposed functional framework in contrast to univariate or multivariate Random Forest predicting sensitivities at different dose levels. Furthermore, we also considered the problem of predicting functional responses from functional predictors i.e., estimating the dose-response curves with a model built on dose-dependent expression data. The superior performance of Functional Random Forest using functional data as compared to existing approaches have been shown using the HMS-LINCS dataset. In summary, Functional Random Forest presents an enhanced predictive modeling framework to predict the entire functional response profile considering both static and functional predictors instead of predicting the summary metrics of the response curves.},

abstract = {Motivation Proteomics profiling is increasingly being used for molecular stratification of cancer patients and cell-line panels. However, systematic assessment of the predictive power of large-scale proteomic technologies across various drug classes and cancer types is currently lacking. To that end, we carried out the first pan-cancer, multi-omics comparative analysis of the relative performance of two proteomic technologies, targeted reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and global mass spectrometry (MS), in terms of their accuracy for predicting the sensitivity of cancer cells to both cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and molecularly targeted anticancer compounds. Results Our results in two cell-line panels demonstrate how MS profiling improves drug response predictions beyond that of the RPPA or the other omics profiles when used alone. However, frequent missing MS data values complicate its use in predictive modeling and required additional filtering, such as focusing on completely measured or known oncoproteins, to obtain maximal predictive performance. Rather strikingly, the two proteomics profiles provided complementary predictive signal both for the cytotoxic and targeted compounds. Further, information about the cellular-abundance of primary target proteins was found critical for predicting the response of targeted compounds, although the non-target features also contributed significantly to the predictive power. The clinical relevance of the selected protein markers was confirmed in cancer patient data. These results provide novel insights into the relative performance and optimal use of the widely applied proteomic technologies, MS and RPPA, which should prove useful in translational applications, such as defining the best combination of omics technologies and marker panels for understanding and predicting drug sensitivities in cancer patients.},

abstract = {Background: Users of a personalised recommendation system face a dilemma: recommendations can be improved by learning from data, but only if other users are willing to share their private information. Good personalised predictions are vitally important in precision medicine, but genomic information on which the predictions are based is also particularly sensitive, as it directly identifies the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However, differentially private learning with current methods does not improve predictions with feasible data sizes and dimensionalities. Results: We show that useful predictors can be learned under powerful differential privacy guarantees, and even from moderately-sized data sets, by demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of private drug sensitivity prediction with a new robust private regression method. Our method matches the predictive accuracy of the state-of-the-art non-private lasso regression using only 4x more samples under relatively strong differential privacy guarantees. Good performance with limited data is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds, therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. Conclusions: The proposed differentially private regression method combines theoretical appeal and asymptotic efficiency with good prediction accuracy even with moderate-sized data. As already the simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields.

abstract = {Individualized therapies ask for the most effective regimen for each patient, while the patients' response may differ from each other. However, it is impossible to clinically evaluate each patient's response due to the large population. Human cell lines have harbored most of the same genetic changes found in patients' tumors, thus are widely used to help understand initial responses of drugs. Based on the more credible assumption that similar cell lines and similar drugs exhibit similar responses, we formulated drug response prediction as a recommender system problem, and then adopted a hybrid interpolation weighted collaborative filtering (HIWCF) method to predict anti-cancer drug responses of cell lines by incorporating cell line similarity and drug similarity shown from gene expression profiles, drug chemical structure as well as drug response similarity. Specifically, we estimated the baseline based on the available responses and shrunk the similarity score for each cell line pair as well as each drug pair. The similarity scores were then shrunk and weighted by the correlation coefficients drawn from the know response between each pair. Before used to find the K most similar neighbors for further prediction, they went through the case amplification strategy to emphasize high similarity and neglect low similarity. In the last step for prediction, cell line-oriented and drug-oriented collaborative filtering models were carried out, and the average of predicted values from both models was used as the final predicted sensitivity. Through 10-fold cross validation, this approach was shown to reach accurate and reproducible outcome for those missing drug sensitivities. We also found that the drug response similarity between cell lines or drugs may play important role in the prediction. Finally, we discussed the biological outcomes based on the newly predicted response values in GDSC dataset.},

Machine learning (ML) is a computational method particularly suited to the establishment of predictive models of drug response based on genomic profiles of targeted cells. We report here on the application of our previously established open-source support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm to predict the responses of 175 individual cancer patients to a variety of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs from the gene-expression profiles (RNA-seq or microarray) of individual patient tumors. The models were found to predict patient responses with >80% accuracy. The high PPV of our algorithms across multiple drugs suggests a potential clinical utility of our approach, particularly with respect to the identification of promising second-line treatments for patients failing standard-of-care first-line therapies.},

abstract = {Personalized medicine implies that distinct treatment methods are prescribed to individual patients according several features that may be obtained from, e.g., gene expression profile. The majority of machine learning methods suffer from the deficiency of preceding cases, i.e. the gene expression data on patients combined with the confirmed outcome of known treatment methods. At the same time, there exist thousands of various cell lines that were treated with hundreds of anti-cancer drugs in order to check the ability of these drugs to stop the cell proliferation, and all these cell line cultures were profiled in terms of their gene expression. Here we present a new approach in machine learning, which can predict clinical efficiency of anti-cancer drugs for individual patients by transferring features obtained from the expression-based data from cell lines. The method was validated on three datasets for cancer-like diseases (chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as lung adenocarcinoma and renal carcinoma) treated with targeted drugs–kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib or sorafenib.},

Here we present PROGENy, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway RespOnsive GENes. Unlike pathway mapping methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival.

Despite the ever-increasing abundance of cancer genomic data, linking mutation profiles to drug efficacy remains a challenge. Herein, we report Cancer Drug Response profile scan (CDRscan) a novel deep learning model that predicts anticancer drug responsiveness based on a large-scale drug screening assay data encompassing genomic profiles of 787 human cancer cell lines and structural profiles of 244 drugs. CDRscan employs a two-step convolution architecture, where the genomic mutational fingerprints of cell lines and the molecular fingerprints of drugs are processed individually, then merged by 'virtual docking', an in silico modelling of drug treatment. Analysis of the goodness-of-fit between observed and predicted drug response revealed a high prediction accuracy of CDRscan (R2 > 0.84; AUROC > 0.98). We applied CDRscan to 1,487 approved drugs and identified 14 oncology and 23 non-oncology drugs having new potential cancer indications. This, to our knowledge, is the first-time application of a deep learning model in predicting the feasibility of drug repurposing. By further clinical validation, CDRscan is expected to allow selection of the most effective anticancer drugs for the genomic profile of the individual patient.},

Identification of predictive molecular features for drug sensitivity holds the key in the era of precision medicine. Human cell lines have harbored most of the same genetic changes found in patients' tumors and thus are widely used in the research of drug response. In this work, we formulated drug-response prediction as a recommender system problem and then adopted a neighbor-based collaborative filtering with global effect removal (NCFGER) method to estimate anti-cancer drug responses of cell lines by integrating cell-line similarity networks and drug similarity networks based on the fact that similar cell lines and similar drugs exhibit similar responses. Specifically, we removed the global effect in the available responses and shrunk the similarity score for each cell line pair as well as each drug pair. We then used the K most similar neighbors (hybrid of cell-line-oriented and drug-oriented) in the available responses to predict the unknown ones. Through 10-fold cross-validation, this approach was shown to reach accurate and reproducible outcomes of drug sensitivity. We also discussed the biological outcomes based on the newly predicted response values.},

In addition, using cancer data from TCGA, we perform an extensive benchmark spanning ten different cancer types, providing the first systematic comparison of leading multi-omics and multi-view clustering algorithms. The results highlight key issues regarding the use of single- versus multi-omics, the choice of clustering strategy, the power of generic multi-view methods and the use of approximated p-values for gauging solution quality.

Predictive models such as Random Forests have shown promising performance while predicting from individual genomic features such as gene expressions.

Results: We explore the predictive performance of model stacking and the effect of stacking on the predictive bias and squared error. In addition we discuss the analytical underpinnings supporting the advantages of stacking in reducing squared error and inherent bias of random forests in prediction of outliers. The framework is tested on a setup including gene expression, drug target, physical properties and drug response information for a set of drugs and cell lines. Conclusion: The performance of individual and stacked models are compared. We note that stacking models built on two heterogeneous datasets provide superior performance to stacking different models built on the same dataset. It is also noted that stacking provides a noticeable reduction in the bias of our predictors when the dominant eigenvalue of the principle axis of variation in the residuals is significantly higher than the remaining eigenvalues.},

Results We propose a method based on ideas from 'recommender systems' (CaDRReS) that predicts cancer drug responses for unseen cell-lines/patients based on learning projections for drugs and cell-lines into a latent 'pharmacogenomic' space. Comparisons with other proposed approaches for this problem based on large public datasets (CCLE and GDSC) show that CaDRReS provides consistently good models and robust predictions even across unseen patient-derived cell-line datasets. Analysis of the pharmacogenomic spaces inferred by CaDRReS also suggests that they can be used to understand drug mechanisms, identify cellular subtypes and further characterize drug-pathway associations.

The data of ERBB2+ GC deposited in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), gene expression omnibus (GEO), InBio Map™, cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), and cancer therapeutics response portal (CTRP) were analyzed. The correlation of expression levels of candidate and IC50 of candidate genes-targeted drugs were verified on NCI-N87 and MKN-45 GC cell lines. We found that RARA, THRA, CACNB1, and TOP2A are drug sensitive biomarkers of ERBB2-targeted treatment with FDA-approved drugs. All these genes act through Myc signaling pathway. Myc is the downstream hub gene of both ERBB2 and RARA. The expression of RARA, THRA, and CACNB1 were negatively correlated with Myc activation, while ERBB2 and TOP2A positively correlated with Myc activation. SH3BGRL3, SH3BGRL, and NRG2 were identified as potential ligands of ERBB2. The ERBB2+ GC with RARA amplification demonstrated better prognosis than those without RARA amplification, while overexpression of NRG2 and SH3BGRL correlated with poor prognosis in ERBB2+ GC. About 90% of ERBB2+ GC was compatible with chromosome instability (CIN) subtype of TCGA, which overlaps with intestinal-type GC in Lauren classification. In validating experiments, combination of Lapatinib and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) synergistically suppresses cell growth, and accompanied by decreased expression of MYC. In conclusions, we identified several predicting biomarkers for ERBB2-targeted therapy and corresponding histological features of ERBB2+ GC.

The results show that the stronger turbulent vortex at the enlarged part in the shroud favors fine bubbles generation and uniform distribution; fine bubbles in diameter of 0.3 to 0.5 mm can be generated in the shroud and tundish by controlling flow rate of gas. The superfluous gas makes bubble size largen sharply. The nozzle size has some effect on bubbles size and distribution; the larger nozzle size goes against fine bubbles generation.

abstract = {Obtaining accurate drug response data in large cohorts of cancer patients is very challenging; thus, most cancer pharmacogenomics discovery is conducted in preclinical studies, typically using cell lines and mouse models. However, these platforms suffer from serious limitations, including small sample sizes. Here, we have developed a novel computational method that allows us to impute drug response in very large clinical cancer genomics data sets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The approach works by creating statistical models relating gene expression to drug response in large panels of cancer cell lines and applying these models to tumor gene expression data in the clinical data sets (e.g., TCGA). This yields an imputed drug response for every drug in each patient. These imputed drug response data are then associated with somatic genetic variants measured in the clinical cohort, such as copy number changes or mutations in protein coding genes. These analyses recapitulated drug associations for known clinically actionable somatic genetic alterations and identified new predictive biomarkers for existing drugs.},

abstract = {Background: Selected gene mutations are routinely used to guide the selection of cancer drugs for a given patient tumour. Large pharmacogenomic data sets, such as those by Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) consortium, were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than standard k-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by the multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: Thanks to this unbiased validation, we now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to some of these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models. R code to facilitate the construction of alternative machine learning models and their validation in the presented benchmark is available at http://ballester.marseille.inserm.fr/gdsc.transcriptomicDatav2.tar.gz.},

abstract = {Traditional machine learning approaches to drug sensitivity prediction assume that training data and test data must be in the same feature space and have the same underlying distribution. However, in real-world applications, this assumption does not hold. For example, we sometimes have limited training data for the task of drug sensitivity prediction in multiple myeloma patients (target task), but we have sufficient auxiliary data for the task of drug sensitivity prediction in patients with another cancer type (related task), where the auxiliary data for the related task are in a different feature space or have a different distribution. In such cases, transfer learning, if applied correctly, would improve the performance of prediction algorithms on the test data of the target task via leveraging the auxiliary data from the related task. In this paper, we present two transfer learning approaches that combine the auxiliary data from the related task with the training data of the target task to improve the prediction performance on the test data of the target task. We evaluate the performance of our transfer learning approaches exploiting three auxiliary data sets and compare them against baseline approaches using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on the test data of the target task. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of our approaches and their superiority over the baseline approaches when auxiliary data are incorporated.},

There is continued research that experiments on drug development for lung cancer patients by assessing their responses to chemotherapeutic treatments to select novel targets for improved therapies. This study aims to analyze the anticancer drug sensitivity in human lung cancer cell lines by using machine learning techniques. The data for this analysis is extracted from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This experiment uses 408,291 human small molecule lung cancer cell lines to conclude. The values are drawn from describing the raw viability values for 91 human lung cancer cell lines treated with 354 different chemical compounds and 432 concentration points tested in each replicate experiments. Our analysis demonstrated the data from a considerable amount of cell lines clustered by using Simple K-means, Filtered clustering and by calculating sensitive drugs for each lung cancer cell line. Additionally, our analysis also demonstrated that the Neopeltolide, Parbendazole, Phloretin and Piperlongumine anti-drug chemical compounds were more sensitive for all 91 cell lines under different concentrations (p-value < 0.001). Our findings indicated that Simple K-means and Filtered clustering methods are completely similar to each other. The available literature on lung cancer cell line data observed a significant relationship between lung cancer and anticancer drugs. Our analysis of the reported experimental results demonstrated that some compounds are more sensitive than other compounds; Phloretin was the most sensitive compound for all lung cancer cell lines which were nearly about 59% out of 91 cell lines. Hence, our observation provides the methodology on how anticancer drug sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines can be analyzed by using machine learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms. This inquiry is a useful reference for researchers who are experimenting on drug developments for the lung cancer in the future.},

Although there are several computational models for accurate drug response prediction, these often lack the ability to infer which feature combinations are the most predictive, particularly for high-dimensional molecular datasets. As increasing amounts of diverse genome-wide data sources are becoming available, there is a need to build new computational models that can effectively combine these data sources and identify maximally predictive feature combinations. Results: We present a novel approach that leverages on systematic integration of data sources to identify response predictive features of multiple drugs. To solve the modeling task we implement a Bayesian linear regression method. To further improve the usefulness of the proposed model, we exploit the known human cancer kinome for identifying biologically relevant feature combinations. In case studies with a synthetic dataset and two publicly available cancer cell line datasets, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our method compared to the widely used approaches in drug response analysis. As key examples, our model identifies meaningful combinations of features for the well known EGFR, ALK, PLK and PDGFR inhibitors.},

abstract = {Drug response prediction is a well-studied problem in which the molecular profile of a given sample is used to predict the effect of a given drug on that sample. Effective solutions to this problem hold the key for precision medicine. In cancer research, genomic data from cell lines are often utilized as features to develop machine learning models predictive of drug response. Molecular networks provide a functional context for the integration of genomic features, thereby resulting in robust and reproducible predictive models. However, inclusion of network data increases dimensionality and poses additional challenges for common machine learning tasks. To overcome these challenges, we here formulate drug response prediction as a link prediction problem. For this purpose, we represent drug response data for a large cohort of cell lines as a heterogeneous network. Using this network, we compute "network profiles" for cell lines and drugs. We then use the associations between these profiles to predict links between drugs and cell lines. Through leave-one-out cross validation and cross-classification on independent datasets, we show that this approach leads to accurate and reproducible classification of sensitive and resistant cell line-drug pairs, with 85% accuracy. We also examine the biological relevance of the network profiles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing data are widely collected and analyzed in the study of complex diseases in quest of improving human health. Well-studied algorithms mostly deal with single data source, and cannot fully utilize the potential of these multi-omics data sources. In order to provide a holistic understanding of human health and diseases, it is necessary to integrate multiple data sources. Several algorithms have been proposed so far, however, a comprehensive comparison of data integration algorithms for classification of binary traits is currently lacking. RESULTS: In this paper, we focus on two common classes of integration algorithms, graph-based that depict relationships with subjects denoted by nodes and relationships denoted by edges, and kernel-based that can generate a classifier in feature space. Our paper provides a comprehensive comparison of their performance in terms of various measurements of classification accuracy and computation time. Seven different integration algorithms, including graph-based semi-supervised learning, graph sharpening integration, composite association network, Bayesian network, semi-definite programming-support vector machine (SDP-SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM) and Ada-boost relevance vector machine are compared and evaluated with hypertension and two cancer data sets in our study. In general, kernel-based algorithms create more complex models and require longer computation time, but they tend to perform better than graph-based algorithms. The performance of graph-based algorithms has the advantage of being faster computationally. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical results demonstrate that composite association network, relevance vector machine, and Ada-boost RVM are the better performers. We provide recommendations on how to choose an appropriate algorithm for integrating data from multiple sources.},

abstract = {Background: Human cancer cell lines are used in research to study the biology of cancer and to test cancer treatments. Recently there are already some large panels of several hundred human cancer cell lines which are characterized with genomic and pharmacological data. The ability to predict drug responses using these pharmacogenomics data can facilitate the development of precision cancer medicines. Although several methods have been developed to address the drug response prediction, there are many challenges in obtaining accurate prediction. Methods: Based on the fact that similar cell lines and similar drugs exhibit similar drug responses, we adopted a similarity-regularized matrix factorization (SRMF) method to predict anticancer drug responses of cell lines using chemical structures of drugs and baseline gene expression levels in cell lines. Specifically, chemical structural similarity of drugs and gene expression profile similarity of cell lines were considered as regularization terms, which were incorporated to the drug response matrix factorization model. Results: We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SRMF using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical similarity-based methods. Furthermore, we applied it to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets, and performance of SRMF exceeds three state-of-the-art methods. We also applied SRMF to estimate the missing drug response values in the GDSC dataset. Even though SRMF does not specifically model mutation information, it could correctly predict drug-cancer gene associations that are consistent with existing data, and identify novel drug-cancer gene associations that are not found in existing data as well. SRMF can also aid in drug repositioning. The newly predicted drug responses of GDSC dataset suggest that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was sensitive to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and expression of AK1RC3 and HINT1 may be adjunct markers of cell line sensitivity to rapamycin. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that the proposed data integration method is able to improve the accuracy of prediction of anticancer drug responses in cell lines, and can identify consistent and novel drug-cancer gene associations compared to existing data as well as aid in drug repositioning.},

For designing a drug sensitivity predictive model from such a database, a natural question arises whether a model trained on diverse inter-tumor heterogeneous samples will perform similar to a predictive model that takes into consideration the heterogeneity of the samples in model training and prediction. We explore this hypothesis and observe that ensemble model predictions obtained when cancer type is known out-perform predictions when that information is withheld even when the samples sizes for the former is considerably lower than the combined sample size. To incorporate the heterogeneity idea in the commonly used ensemble based predictive model of Random Forests, we propose Heterogeneity Aware Random Forests (HARF) that assigns weights to the trees based on the category of the sample. We treat heterogeneity as a latent class allocation problem and present a covariate free class allocation approach based on the distribution of leaf nodes of the model ensemble. Applications on CCLE and GDSC databases show that HARF outperforms traditional Random Forest when the average drug responses of cancer types are different.},

abstract = {Motivation: A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients. This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can effectively model and predict drug responses. Results: In this study, we propose a novel formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF) method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly available cancer datasets as well as on a synthetic dataset. In addition, we validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by the proposed model for the well-known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.

abstract = {Motivation: Clinical response to anti-cancer drugs varies between patients. A large portion of this variation can be explained by differences in molecular features, such as mutation status, copy number alterations, methylation and gene expression profiles. We show that the classic approach for combining these molecular features (Elastic Net regression on all molecular features simultaneously) results in models that are almost exclusively based on gene expression. The gene expression features selected by the classic approach are difficult to interpret as they often represent poorly studied combinations of genes, activated by aberrations in upstream signaling pathways. Results: To utilize all data types in a more balanced way, we developed TANDEM, a two-stage approach in which the first stage explains response using upstream features (mutations, copy number, methylation and cancer type) and the second stage explains the remainder using downstream features (gene expression). Applying TANDEM to 934 cell lines profiled across 265 drugs (GDSC1000), we show that the resulting models are more interpretable, while retaining the same predictive performance as the classic approach. Using the more balanced contributions per data type as determined with TANDEM, we find that response to MAPK pathway inhibitors is largely predicted by mutation data, while predicting response to DNA damaging agents requires gene expression data, in particular SLFN11 expression. Availability and Implementation: TANDEM is available as an R package on CRAN (for more information, see http://ccb.nki.nl/software/tandem).},

abstract = {Accurately predicting drug responses to cancer is an important problem hindering oncologists' efforts to find the most effective drugs to treat cancer, which is a core goal in precision medicine. The scientific community has focused on improving this prediction based on genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic datasets measured in human cancer cell lines. Real-world cancer cell lines contain noise, which degrades the performance of machine learning algorithms. This problem is rarely addressed in the existing approaches. In this paper, we present a noise-filtering approach that integrates techniques from numerical linear algebra and information retrieval targeted at filtering out noisy cancer cell lines. By filtering out noisy cancer cell lines, we can train machine learning algorithms on better quality cancer cell lines. We evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it with an existing approach using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) on clinical trial data. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is stable and also yields the highest AUC at a statistically significant level.},

These biclustering techniques have focused on one data source, often gene expression data. We present a Bayesian approach for joint biclustering of multiple data sources, extending a recent method Group Factor Analysis to have a biclustering interpretation with additional sparsity assumptions. The resulting method enables data-driven detection of linear structure present in parts of the data sources. Results: Our simulation studies show that the proposed method reliably infers biclusters from heterogeneous data sources. We tested the method on data from the NCI-DREAM drug sensitivity prediction challenge, resulting in an excellent prediction accuracy. Moreover, the predictions are based on several biclusters which provide insight into the data sources, in this case on gene expression, DNA methylation, protein abundance, exome sequence, functional connectivity fingerprints and drug sensitivity.},

abstract = {In 2013, we published a comparative analysis mutation and gene expression profiles and drug sensitivity measurements for 15 drugs characterized in the 471 cancer cell lines screened in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). While we found good concordance in gene expression profiles, there was substantial inconsistency in the drug responses reported by the GDSC and CCLE projects. We received extensive feedback on the comparisons that we performed. This feedback, along with the release of new data, prompted us to revisit our initial analysis. Here we present a new analysis using these expanded data in which we address the most significant suggestions for improvements on our published analysis — that targeted therapies and broad cytotoxic drugs should have been treated differently in assessing consistency, that consistency of both molecular profiles and drug sensitivity measurements should both be compared across cell lines, and that the software analysis tools we provided should have been easier to run, particularly as the GDSC and CCLE released additional data. Our re-analysis supports our previous finding that gene expression data are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity measurements. The use of new statistics to assess data consistency allowed us to identify two broad effect drugs and three targeted drugs with moderate to good consistency in drug sensitivity data between GDSC and CCLE. For three other targeted drugs, there were not enough sensitive cell lines to assess the consistency of the pharmacological profiles. We found evidence of inconsistencies in pharmacological phenotypes for the remaining eight drugs. Overall, our findings suggest that the drug sensitivity data in GDSC and CCLE continue to present challenges for robust biomarker discovery. This re-analysis provides additional support for the argument that experimental standardization and validation of pharmacogenomic response will be necessary to advance the broad use of large pharmacogenomic screens.},

To test this idea, we correlated the sensitivity patterns of 481 compounds with $\sim$19,000 basal transcript levels across 823 different human cancer cell lines and identified selective outlier transcripts. This process yielded many novel mechanistic insights, including the identification of activation mechanisms, cellular transporters, and direct protein targets.

Individual prediction of drug response has great potential to aid in improving the clinical outcome and reduce the financial costs associated with prescribing chemotherapy drugs to which the patient's tumor might be resistant. In this paper we develop a network based classifier (NBC) method for predicting sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs from transcriptome data. In the literature, this strategy has been used for predicting cancer types. Here, we extend it to estimate sensitivity of cells from different tumor types to various anticancer drugs. Furthermore, we incorporate domain specific knowledge such as the use of apoptotic gene list and clinical dose information in our method to impart biological significance to the prediction.

These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

Ensemble based approaches such as Random Forests have been shown to perform well in both individual sensitivity prediction studies and team science based prediction challenges. However, Random Forests generate a deterministic predictive model for each drug based on the genetic characterization of the cell lines and ignores the relationship between different drug sensitivities during model generation. This application motivates the need for generation of multivariate ensemble learning techniques that can increase prediction accuracy and improve variable importance ranking by incorporating the relationships between different output responses. In this article, we propose a novel cost criterion that captures the dissimilarity in the output response structure between the training data and node samples as the difference in the two empirical copulas. We illustrate that copulas are suitable for capturing the multivariate structure of output responses independent of the marginal distributions and the copula based multivariate random forest framework can provide higher accuracy prediction and improved variable selection. The proposed framework has been validated on genomics of drug sensitivity for cancer and cancer cell line encyclopedia database.},

abstract = {Background: Patients suffering from cancer are often treated with a range of chemotherapeutic agents, but the treatment efficacy varies greatly between patients. Based on recent popularisation of regularised regression models the goal of this study was to establish workflows for pharmacogenomic predictors of response to standard multidrug regimens using baseline gene expression data and origin specific cell lines. The proposed workflows are tested on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP first-line therapy. Methods: First, B-cell cancer cell lines were tested successively for resistance towards the chemotherapeutic components of R-CHOP: cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), and vincristine (O). Second, baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line before treatment. Third, regularised multivariate regression models with cross-validated tuning parameters were used to generate classifier and predictor based resistance gene signatures (REGS) for the combination and individual chemotherapeutic drugs C, H, and O. Fourth, each developed REGS was used to assign resistance levels to individual patients in three clinical cohorts. Results: Both classifier and predictor based REGS, for the combination CHO, were of prognostic value. For patients classified as resistant towards CHO the risk of progression was 2.33 (95% CI: 1.6, 3.3) times greater than for those classified as sensitive. Similarly, an increase in the predicted CHO resistance index of 10 was related to a 22% (9%, 36%) increased risk of progression. Furthermore, the REGS classifier performed significantly better than the REGS predictor. Conclusions: The regularised multivariate regression models provide a flexible workflow for drug resistance studies with promising potential. However, the gene expressions defining the REGSs should be functionally validated and correlated to known biomarkers to improve understanding of molecular mechanisms of drug resistance.},

abstract = {Large-scale pharmacogenomic screens of cancer cell lines have emerged as an attractive pre- clinical system for identifying tumor genetic subtypes with selective sensitivity to targeted therapeutic strategies. Application of modern machine learning approaches to pharmacogenomic datasets have demonstrated the ability to infer genomic predictors of compound sensitivity. Such modeling approaches entail many analytical design choices; however, a systematic study evaluating the relative performance attributable to each design choice is not yet available. In this work, we evaluated over 110,000 different models, based on a multifactorial experimental design testing systematic combinations of modeling factors within several categories of modeling choices, including: type of algorithm, type of molecular feature data, compound being predicted, method of summarizing compound sensitivity values, and whether predictions are based on discretized or continuous response values. Our results suggest that model input data (type of molecular features and choice of compound) are the primary factors explaining model performance, followed by choice of algorithm. Our results also provide a statistically principled set of recommended modeling guidelines, including: using elastic net or ridge regression with input features from all genomic profiling platforms, most importantly, gene expression features, to predict continuous-valued sensitivity scores summarized using the area under the dose response curve, with pathway targeted compounds most likely to yield the most accurate predictors. In addition, our study provides a publicly available resource of all modeling results, an open source code base, and experimental design for researchers throughout the community to build on our results and assess novel methodologies or applications in related predictive modeling problems},

abstract = {The ability to predict the response of a cancer patient to a therapeutic agent is a major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to personalized treatment. Existing approaches to predicting drug sensitivity rely primarily on profiling of cancer cell line panels that have been treated with different drugs and selecting genomic or functional genomic features to regress or classify the drug response. Here, we propose a dual-layer integrated cell line-drug network model, which uses both cell line similarity network (CSN) data and drug similarity network (DSN) data to predict the drug response of a given cell line using a weighted model. Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Genome Project (CGP) studies as benchmark datasets, our single-layer model with CSN or DSN and only a single parameter achieved a prediction performance comparable to the previously generated elastic net model. When using the dual-layer model integrating both CSN and DSN, our predicted response reached a 0.6 Pearson correlation coefficient with observed responses for most drugs, which is significantly better than the previous results using the elastic net model. We have also applied the dual-layer cell line-drug integrated network model to fill in the missing drug response values in the CGP dataset. Even though the dual-layer integrated cell line-drug network model does not specifically model mutation information, it correctly predicted that BRAF mutant cell lines would be more sensitive than BRAF wild-type cell lines to three MEK1/2 inhibitors tested.},

abstract = {Motivation: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cancer require personalized therapies owing to their inherent heterogeneous nature. For both diseases, large-scale pharmacogenomic screens of molecularly characterized samples have been generated with the hope of identifying genetic predictors of drug susceptibility. Thus, computational algorithms capable of inferring robust predictors of drug responses from genomic information are of great practical importance. Most of the existing computational studies that consider drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs formulate a separate learning problem for each drug, which cannot make use of commonalities between subsets of drugs. Results: In this study, we propose to solve the problem of drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs in a multitask learning framework by formulating a novel Bayesian algorithm that combines kernel-based non-linear dimensionality reduction and binary classification (or regression). The main novelty of our method is the joint Bayesian formulation of projecting data points into a shared subspace and learning predictive models for all drugs in this subspace, which helps us to eliminate off-target effects and drug-specific experimental noise. Another novelty of our method is the ability of handling missing phenotype values owing to experimental conditions and quality control reasons. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via crossvalidation experiments on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets of HIV and cancer. Our method obtains statistically significantly better predictive performance on most of the drugs compared with baseline single-task algorithms that learn drug-specific models. These results show that predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs simultaneously within a multitask learning framework improves overall predictive performance over single-task learning approaches.. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

The main goal is to simultaneously predict (in silico) anticancer responses by extracting common patterns among tumour cell lines, selecting genes that could potentially explain the therapy outcome and finally learning a probabilistic model able to predict the therapeutic responses. Results: The experimental investigation performed on the NCI60 dataset highlights three main findings: (1) Consensus p-Median is able to create groups of cell lines that are highly correlated both in terms of gene expression and drug response; (2) from a biological point of view, the proposed approach enables the selection of genes that are strongly involved in several cancer processes; (3) the final prediction of drug responses, built upon Consensus p-Median and the selected genes, represents a promising step for predicting potential useful drugs.

abstract = {High-throughput 'omic' data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, DNA copy number, has played an instrumental role in furthering our understanding of the molecular basis in states of human health and disease. As cells with similar morphological characteristics can exhibit entirely different molecular profiles and because of the potential that these discrepancies might further our understanding of patient-level variability in clinical outcomes, there is significant interest in the use of high-throughput 'omic' data for the identification of novel molecular subtypes of a disease. While numerous clustering methods have been proposed for identifying of molecular subtypes, most were developed for single 'omic' data types and may not be appropriate when more than one 'omic' data type are collected on study subjects. Given that complex diseases, such as cancer, arise as a result of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations, integrative clustering methods for the simultaneous clustering of multiple 'omic' data types have great potential to aid in molecular subtype discovery. Traditionally, ad hoc manual data integration has been performed using the results obtained from the clustering of individual 'omic' data types on the same set of patient samples. However, such methods often result in inconsistent assignment of subjects to the molecular cancer subtypes. Recently, several methods have been proposed in the literature that offers a rigorous framework for the simultaneous integration of multiple 'omic' data types in a single comprehensive analysis.

abstract = {Cox regression is commonly used to predict the outcome by the time to an event of interest and in addition, identify relevant features for survival analysis in cancer genomics. Due to the high-dimensionality of high-throughput genomic data, existing Cox models trained on any particular dataset usually generalize poorly to other independent datasets. In this paper, we propose a network-based Cox regression model called Net-Cox and applied Net-Cox for a large-scale survival analysis across multiple ovarian cancer datasets. Net-Cox integrates gene network information into the Cox's proportional hazard model to explore the co-expression or functional relation among high-dimensional gene expression features in the gene network. Net-Cox was applied to analyze three independent gene expression datasets including the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and two other public ovarian cancer datasets. Net-Cox with the network information from gene co-expression or functional relations identified highly consistent signature genes across the three datasets, and because of the better generalization across the datasets, Net-Cox also consistently improved the accuracy of survival prediction over the Cox models regularized by L2-norm or L1-norm. This study focused on analyzing the death and recurrence outcomes in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma to identify signature genes that can more reliably predict the events. The signature genes comprise dense protein-protein interaction subnetworks, enriched by extracellular matrix receptors and modulators or by nuclear signaling components downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. In the laboratory validation of the signature genes, a tumor array experiment by protein staining on an independent patient cohort from Mayo Clinic showed that the protein expression of the signature gene FBN1 is a biomarker significantly associated with the early recurrence after 12 months of the treatment in the ovarian cancer patients who are initially sensitive to chemotherapy.

abstract = {Predicting the response of a specific cancer to a therapy is a major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a personalised treatment. High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the considered drugs. Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R2 of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC50 values rather than experimentally measuring them. The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Menden et al.},

abstract = {Background: First-generation molecular profiles for human breast cancers have enabled the identification of features that can predict therapeutic response; however, little is known about how the various data types can best be combined to yield optimal predictors. Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many aspects of breast cancer molecular pathobiology, and measurements of their omic and biological therapeutic responses are well-suited for development of strategies to identify the most predictive molecular feature sets. Results: We used least squares-support vector machines and random forest algorithms to identify molecular features associated with responses of a collection of 70 breast cancer cell lines to 90 experimental or approved therapeutic agents. The datasets analyzed included measurements of copy number aberrations, mutations, gene and isoform expression, promoter methylation and protein expression. Transcriptional subtype contributed strongly to response predictors for 25% of compounds, and adding other molecular data types improved prediction for 65%. No single molecular dataset consistently out-performed the others, suggesting that therapeutic response is mediated at multiple levels in the genome. Response predictors were developed and applied to TCGA data, and were found to be present in subsets of those patient samples. Conclusions: These results suggest that matching patients to treatments based on transcriptional subtype will improve response rates, and inclusion of additional features from other profiling data types may provide additional benefit. Further, we suggest a systems biology strategy for guiding clinical trials so that patient cohorts most likely to respond to new therapies may be more efficiently identified.},

abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

abstract = {Alterations in cancer genomes strongly influence clinical responses to treatment and in many instances are potent biomarkers for response to drugs. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database (www.cancerRxgene.org) is the largest public resource for information on drug sensitivity in cancer cells and molecular markers of drug response. Data are freely available without restriction. GDSC currently contains drug sensitivity data for almost 75000 experiments, describing response to 138 anticancer drugs across almost 700 cancer cell lines. To identify molecular markers of drug response, cell line drug sensitivity data are integrated with large genomic datasets obtained from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database, including information on somatic mutations in cancer genes, gene amplification and deletion, tissue type and tran-scriptional data. Analysis of GDSC data is through a web portal focused on identifying molecular bio-markers of drug sensitivity based on queries of specific anticancer drugs or cancer genes. Graphical representations of the data are used throughout with links to related resources and all datasets are fully downloadable. GDSC provides a unique resource incorporating large drug sensitivity and genomic datasets to facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic biomarkers for cancer therapies. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is a molecular modification of DNA that plays crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. Particularly, CpG rich regions are frequently hypermethylated in cancer tissues, but not methylated in normal tissues. However, there are not many methodological literatures of case-control association studies for high-dimensional DNA methylation data, compared with those of microarray gene expression. One key feature of DNA methylation data is a grouped structure among CpG sites from a gene that are possibly highly correlated. In this article, we proposed a penalized logistic regression model for correlated DNA methylation CpG sites within genes from high-dimensional array data. Our regularization procedure is based on a combination of the l1 penalty and squared l2 penalty on degree-scaled differences of coefficients of CpG sites within one gene, so it induces both sparsity and smoothness with respect to the correlated regression coefficients. We combined the penalized procedure with a stability selection procedure such that a selection probability of each regression coefficient was provided which helps us make a stable and confident selection of methylation CpG sites that are possibly truly associated with the outcome.Results: Using simulation studies we demonstrated that the proposed procedure outperforms existing main-stream regularization methods such as lasso and elastic-net when data is correlated within a group. We also applied our method to identify important CpG sites and corresponding genes for ovarian cancer from over 20 000 CpGs generated from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27K Beadchip. Some genes identified are potentially associated with cancers. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines-which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers-with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: One of the major goals in gene and protein expression profiling of cancer is to identify biomarkers and build classification models for prediction of disease prognosis or treatment response. Many traditional statistical methods, based on microarray gene expression data alone and individual genes' discriminatory power, often fail to identify biologically meaningful biomarkers thus resulting in poor prediction performance across data sets. Nonetheless, the variables in multivariable classifiers should synergistically interact to produce more effective classifiers than individual biomarkers.Results: We developed an integrated approach, namely network-constrained support vector machine (netSVM), for cancer biomarker identification with an improved prediction performance. The netSVM approach is specifically designed for network biomarker identification by integrating gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data. We first evaluated the effectiveness of netSVM using simulation studies, demonstrating its improved performance over state-of-the-art network-based methods and gene-based methods for network biomarker identification. We then applied the netSVM approach to two breast cancer data sets to identify prognostic signatures for prediction of breast cancer metastasis. The experimental results show that: (1) network biomarkers identified by netSVM are highly enriched in biological pathways associated with cancer progression; (2) prediction performance is much improved when tested across different data sets. Specifically, many genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell proliferation, which are hallmark signatures of breast cancer metastasis, were identified by the netSVM approach. More importantly, several novel hub genes, biologically important with many interactions in PPI network but often showing little change in expression as compared with their downstream genes, were also identified as network biomarkers; the genes were enriched in signaling pathways such as TGF-beta signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. These signaling pathways may provide new insight to the underlying mechanism of breast cancer metastasis.Conclusions: We have developed a network-based approach for cancer biomarker identification, netSVM, resulting in an improved prediction performance with network biomarkers. We have applied the netSVM approach to breast cancer gene expression data to predict metastasis in patients. Network biomarkers identified by netSVM reveal potential signaling pathways associated with breast cancer metastasis, and help improve the prediction performance across independent data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The ability to predict drug sensitivity in cancer is one of the exciting promises of pharmacogenomic research. Several groups have demonstrated the ability to predict drug sensitivity by integrating chemo-sensitivity data and associated gene expression measurements from large anti-cancer drug screens such as NCI-60. The general approach is based on comparing gene expression measurements from sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and deriving drug sensitivity profiles consisting of lists of genes whose expression is predictive of response to a drug. Importantly, it has been shown that such profiles are generic and can be applied to cancer cell lines that are not part of the anti-cancer screen. However, one limitation is that the profiles can not be generated for untested drugs (i.e., drugs that are not part of an anti-cancer drug screen). In this work, we propose using an existing drug sensitivity profile for drug A as a substitute for an untested drug B given high structural similarities between drugs A and B. Results: We first show that structural similarity between pairs of compounds in the NCI-60 dataset highly correlates with the similarity between their activities across the cancer cell lines. This result shows that structurally similar drugs can be expected to have a similar effect on cancer cell lines. We next set out to test our hypothesis that we can use existing drug sensitivity profiles as substitute profiles for untested drugs. In a cross-validation experiment, we found that the use of substitute profiles is possible without a significant loss of prediction accuracy if the substitute profile was generated from a compound with high structural similarity to the untested compound. Conclusion: Anti-cancer drug screens are a valuable resource for generating omics-based drug sensitivity profiles. We show that it is possible to extend the usefulness of existing screens to untested drugs by deriving substitute sensitivity profiles from structurally similar drugs part of the screen. {\textcopyright} 2009 Shivakumar and Krauthammer; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The advent of microarray technology has made it possible to classify disease states based on gene expression profiles of patients. Typically, marker genes are selected by measuring the power of their expression profiles to discriminate among patients of different disease states. However, expression-based classification can be challenging in complex diseases due to factors such as cellular heterogeneity within a tissue sample and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for coping with these challenges is to incorporate pathway information into the disease classification procedure in order to classify disease based on the activity of entire signaling pathways or protein complexes rather than on the expression levels of individual genes or proteins. We propose a new classification method based on pathway activities inferred for each patient. For each pathway, an activity level is summarized from the gene expression levels of its condition-responsive genes (CORGs), defined as the subset of genes in the pathway whose combined expression delivers optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype. We show that classifiers using pathway activity achieve better performance than classifiers based on individual gene expression, for both simple and complex case-control studies including differentiation of perturbed from non-perturbed cells and subtyping of several different kinds of cancer. Moreover, the new method outperforms several previous approaches that use a static (i.e., non-conditional) definition of pathways. Within a pathway, the identified CORGs may facilitate the development of better diagnostic markers and the discovery of core alterations in human disease. {\textcopyright} 2008 Lee et al.},

abstract = {Motivation: A central problem in biomarker discovery from large-scale gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is the computational challenge of taking into account the dependence among all the features. Methods that ignore the dependence usually identify non-reproducible biomarkers across independent datasets. We introduce a new graph-based semi-supervised feature classification algorithm to identify discriminative disease markers by learning on bipartite graphs. Our algorithm directly classifies the feature nodes in a bipartite graph as positive, negative or neutral with network propagation to capture the dependence among both samples and features (clinical and genetic variables) by exploring bi-cluster structures in a graph. Two features of our algorithm are: (1) our algorithm can find a global optimal labeling to capture the dependence among all the features and thus, generates highly reproducible results across independent microarray or other high-thoughput datasets, (2) our algorithm is capable of handling hundreds of thousands of features and thus, is particularly useful for biomarker identification from high-throughput gene expression and SNP data. In addition, although designed for classifying features, our algorithm can also simultaneously classify test samples for disease prognosis/diagnosis. Results: We applied the network propagation algorithm to study three large-scale breast cancer datasets. Our algorithm achieved competitive classification performance compared with SVMs and other baseline methods, and identified several markers with clinical or biological relevance with the disease. More importantly, our algorithm also identified highly reproducible marker genes and enriched functions from the independent datasets. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors. {\textcopyright} 2007 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

We sought to determine whether the gene expression signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of chemosensitivity. Gene expression-based classifiers of sensitivity or resistance for 232 compounds were generated and then evaluated on independent sets of data. The classifiers were designed to be independent of the cells' tissue of origin. The accuracy of chemosensitivity prediction was considerably better than would be expected by chance. Eighty-eight of 232 expression-based classifiers performed accurately (with P < 0.05) on an independent test set, whereas only 12 of the 232 would be expected to do so by chance.

abstract = {Anti-cancer drug sensitivity prediction using deep learning models for individual cell line is a significant challenge in personalized medicine. REFINED (REpresentation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies) CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based models have shown promising results in drug sensitivity prediction. The primary idea behind REFINED CNN is representing high dimensional vectors as compact images with spatial correlations that can benefit from convolutional neural network architectures. However, the mapping from a vector to a compact 2D image is not unique due to variations in considered distance measures and neighborhoods. In this article, we consider predictions based on ensembles built from such mappings that can improve upon the best single REFINED CNN model prediction. Results illustrated using NCI60 and NCIALMANAC databases shows that the ensemble approaches can provide significant performance improvement as compared to individual models. We further illustrate that a single mapping created from the amalgamation of the different mappings can provide performance similar to stacking ensemble but with significantly lower computational complexity.},

abstract = {We present the Network-based Biased Tree Ensembles (NetBiTE) method for drug sensitivity prediction and drug sensitivity biomarker identification in cancer using a combination of prior knowledge and gene expression data. Our devised method consists of a biased tree ensemble that is built according to a probabilistic bias weight distribution. The bias weight distribution is obtained from the assignment of high weights to the drug targets and propagating the assigned weights over a protein-protein interaction network such as STRING. The propagation of weights, defines neighborhoods of influence around the drug targets and as such simulates the spread of perturbations within the cell, following drug administration. Using a synthetic dataset, we showcase how application of biased tree ensembles (BiTE) results in significant accuracy gains at a much lower computational cost compared to the unbiased random forests (RF) algorithm. We then apply NetBiTE to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset and demonstrate that NetBiTE outperforms RF in predicting IC50 drug sensitivity, only for drugs that target membrane receptor pathways (MRPs): RTK, EGFR and IGFR signaling pathways. We propose based on the NetBiTE results, that for drugs that inhibit MRPs, the expression of target genes prior to drug administration is a biomarker for IC50 drug sensitivity following drug administration. We further verify and reinforce this proposition through control studies on, PI3K/MTOR signaling pathway inhibitors, a drug category that does not target MRPs, and through assignment of dummy targets to MRP inhibiting drugs and investigating the variation in NetBiTE accuracy.},

abstract = {In silico models to predict which tumors will respond to a given drug are necessary for Precision Oncology. However, predictive models are only available for a handful of cases (each case being a given drug acting on tumors of a specific cancer type). A way to generate predictive models for the remaining cases is with suitable machine learning algorithms that are yet to be applied to existing in vitro pharmacogenomics datasets. Here, we apply XGBoost integrated with a stringent feature selection approach, which is an algorithm that is advantageous for these high-dimensional problems. Thus, we identified and validated 118 predictive models for 62 drugs across five cancer types by exploiting four molecular profiles (sequence mutations, copy-number alterations, gene expression, and DNA methylation). Predictive models were found in each cancer type and with every molecular profile. On average, no omics profile or cancer type obtained models with higher predictive accuracy than the rest. However, within a given cancer type, some molecular profiles were overrepresented among predictive models. For instance, CNA profiles were predictive in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) cell lines, but not in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines where gene expression (GEX) and DNA methylation profiles were the most predictive. Lastly, we identified the best XGBoost model per cancer type and analyzed their selected features. For each model, some of the genes in the selected list had already been found to be individually linked to the response to that drug, providing additional evidence of the usefulness of these models and the merits of the feature selection scheme.},

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents.

abstract = {Background: An enduring challenge in personalized medicine is to select right drug for individual patients. Testing drugs on patients in large clinical trials is one way to assess their efficacy and toxicity, but it is impractical to test hundreds of drugs currently under development. Therefore the preclinical prediction model is highly expected as it enables prediction of drug response to hundreds of cell lines in parallel. Methods: Recently, two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies screened multiple anticancer drugs on over 1000 cell lines in an effort to elucidate the response mechanism of anticancer drugs. To this aim, we here used gene expression features and drug sensitivity data in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to build a predictor based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a recursive feature selection tool. Robustness of our model was validated by cross-validation and an independent dataset, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP). Results: Our model achieved good cross validation performance for most drugs in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (≥80% accuracy for 10 drugs, ≥ 75% accuracy for 19 drugs). Independent tests on eleven common drugs between CCLE and CGP achieved satisfactory performance for three of them, i.e., AZD6244, Erlotinib and PD-0325901, using expression levels of only twelve, six and seven genes, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that drug response could be effectively predicted from genomic features. Our model could be applied to predict drug response for some certain drugs and potentially play a complementary role in personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Model-based prediction is dependent on many choices ranging from the sample collection and prediction endpoint to the choice of algorithm and its parameters. Here we studied the effects of such choices, exemplified by predicting sensitivity (as IC50) of cancer cell lines towards a variety of compounds. For this, we used three independent sample collections and applied several machine learning algorithms for predicting a variety of endpoints for drug response. We compared all possible models for combinations of sample collections, algorithm, drug, and labeling to an identically generated null model. The predictability of treatment effects varies among compounds, i.e. response could be predicted for some but not for all. The choice of sample collection plays a major role towards lowering the prediction error, as does sample size. However, we found that no algorithm was able to consistently outperform the other and there was no significant difference between regression and two- or three class predictors in this experimental setting. These results indicate that response-modeling projects should direct efforts mainly towards sample collection and data quality, rather than method adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bayer et al.},

These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based on cellular, genetic, or expression biomarkers of cancer cells. However, a remaining challenge is an efficient way to identify accurate sets of biomarkers to validate. To address this challenge, we developed methodology using gene-expression profiles of human cancer cell lines to predict the responses of these cell lines to a panel of compounds. Results: We developed an iterative weighting scheme which, when applied to elastic net, a regularized regression method, significantly improves the overall accuracy of predictions, particularly in the highly sensitive response region. In addition to application of these methods to actual chemical sensitivity data, we investigated the effects of sample size, number of features, model sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio, andfeature correlation on predictive performance using a simulation framework, particularly for situations where the number of covariates is much larger than sample size. While our method aims to be useful in therapeutic discovery and understanding of the basic mechanisms of action of drugs and their targets, it is generally applicable in any domain where predictions of extreme responses are of highest importance.},

We propose a sparse multitask regression model which learns discriminative latent characteristics that predict drug sensitivity and are associated with specific molecular features. We use ideas from Bayesian nonparametrics to automatically infer the appropriate number of these latent characteristics. The resulting analysis couples high predictive performance with interpretability since each latent characteristic involves a typically small set of drugs, cell lines and genomic features. Our model uncovers a number of drug-gene sensitivity associations missed by single gene analyses. We functionally validate one such novel association: that increased expression of the cell-cycle regulator C/EBP$\delta$ decreases sensitivity to the histone deacety-lase (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat.},

Using genome-wide, DNA methylation profiles from 987 cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we applied machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the potential to predict cytotoxic responses for eight anti-cancer drugs. We compared the performance of five classification algorithms and four regression algorithms that use diverse methodologies, including tree-, probability-, kernel-, ensemble-, and distance-based approaches. For both types of algorithm, we artificially subsampled the data to varying degrees, aiming to understand whether training models based on relatively extreme outcomes would yield improved performance. We also performed an information-gain analysis to examine which genes were most predictive of drug responses. Finally, we used tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate the feasibility of predicting clinical responses in humans based on models derived from cell lines. When using classification or regression algorithms to predict discrete or continuous responses, respectively, we consistently observed excellent predictive performance when the training and test sets both consisted of cell-line data.

Machine learning algorithms applied to those datasets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a Bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the interactions between the drug targets and signaling pathways' activation. A typical insight would be: "Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X". We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using gene expression of 990 cancer cell lines, activity scores of 11 signaling pathways derived from the tool PROGENy as cell line input and 228 nominal targets for 265 drugs as drug input. These interactions can guide a tissue-specific combination treatment strategy, for example suggesting to modulate a certain pathway to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help target discovery, drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies.},

@article{Bromane2019,
abstract = {To address the problem of resistance to paclitaxel treatment, we have investigated to which extent is possible to predict Breast Cancer (BC) patient response to this drug. We carried out a large-scale tumor-based prediction analysis using data from the US National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons. These data sets comprise the responses of BC patients to paclitaxel along with six molecular profiles of their tumors. We assessed 10 Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on each of these profiles and evaluated the resulting 60 classifiers on the same BC patients. DNA methylation and miRNA profiles were the most informative overall. In combination with these two profiles, ML algorithms selecting the smallest subset of molecular features generated the most predictive classifiers: a complexity-optimized XGBoost classifier based on CpG island methylation extracted a subset of molecular factors relevant to predict paclitaxel response (AUC = 0.74). A CpG site methylation-based Decision Tree (DT) combining only 2 of the 22,941 considered CpG sites (AUC = 0.89) and a miRNA expression-based DT employing just 4 of the 337 analyzed mature miRNAs (AUC = 0.72) reveal the molecular types associated to paclitaxel-sensitive and resistant BC tumors. A literature review shows that features selected by these three classifiers have been individually linked to the cytotoxic-drug sensitivities and prognosis of BC patients. Our work leads to several molecular signatures, unearthed from methylome and miRNome, able to anticipate to some extent which BC tumors respond or not to paclitaxel. These results may provide insights to optimize paclitaxel-therapies in clinical practice.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of predicting sensitivity of cancer cell lines to new drugs based on supervised learning on genomic profiles. The genetic and epigenetic characterization of a cell line provides observations on various aspects of regulation including DNA copy number variations, gene expression, DNA methylation and protein abundance. To extract relevant information from the various data types, we applied a random forest based approach to generate sensitivity predictions from each type of data and combined the predictions in a linear regression model to generate the final drug sensitivity prediction. Our approach when applied to the NCI-DREAM drug sensitivity prediction challenge was a top performer among 47 teams and produced high accuracy predictions. Our results show that the incorporation of multiple genomic characterizations lowered the mean and variance of the estimated bootstrap prediction error. We also applied our approach to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database for sensitivity prediction and the ability to extract the top targets of an anti-cancer drug. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting drug sensitivity from heterogeneous genomic datasets. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wan, Pal.},

abstract = {Understanding the categorization of human diseases is critical for reliably identifying disease causal genes. Recently, genome-wide studies of abnormal chromosomal locations related to diseases have mapped >2000 phenotype-gene relations, which provide valuable information for classifying diseases and identifying candidate genes as drug targets. In this article, a regularized non-negative matrix tri-factorization (R-NMTF) algorithm is introduced to co-cluster phenotypes and genes, and simultaneously detect associations between the detected phenotype clusters and gene clusters. The R-NMTF algorithm factorizes the phenotype-gene association matrix under the prior knowledge from phenotype similarity network and protein-protein interaction network, supervised by the label information from known disease classes and biological pathways. In the experiments on disease phenotype-gene associations in OMIM and KEGG disease pathways, R-NMTF significantly improved the classification of disease phenotypes and disease pathway genes compared with support vector machines and Label Propagation in cross-validation on the annotated phenotypes and genes. The newly predicted phenotypes in each disease class are highly consistent with human phenotype ontology annotations. The roles of the new member genes in the disease pathways are examined and validated in the protein-protein interaction subnetworks. Extensive literature review also confirmed many new members of the disease classes and pathways as well as the predicted associations between disease phenotype classes and pathways. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},
